            <p><strong>Project :</strong> Basic 3D Graphics Engine and Game Engine</p>
            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>
                Trynity engine is a basic implementation of a 3D graphics engine and a game engine. It utilizes
                technoligies such as texture rasterization, mipmapping, z-buffering, multithreading and more to
                render 3D object. The game engine implements 3D objects, entities, and an axis-aligned 
                collision box system that can be used for many different applications such as hitboxes, deathboxes, 
                and collision-detection. In this description i will talk about how Trynity engine was made, 
                what difficulties i experienced when making it, and how i came to the decisions i did when 
                making it.

                This project was originally made as a semester project for the course INF101 at the University 
                of Bergen, where it won the award for the most impressive project. I got the idea for this
                project when i was playing around with making a very basic 3D raycaster in python, and i
                wanted to expand on this. The goal was to make a first person shooter game resembling the 
                original DOOM game, which i belive i succeeded in doing.
            </p>
            <p>
                When development started i had 4 weeks to make the project, and i quickly realized that i
                would need to spend every moment i had if i wanted to finish it in time. I started by making
                a recreation of the raycaster i had made in python, but in Java. The difference was this time
                i knew i needed to expand it so that the camera object could rotate and move around, which was
                a task that proved to be more difficult than i had anticipated, as the method i had previously
                used to render 3D object was not at all compatible with the new goals i had in mind. So the first
                few days of development were spent just trying to figure a system that would work with camera rotation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually i believed i had found a solution that involved rotating every 3D object in the scene backwards
                the rotation the camera had, but i still had the issue of faces outside the camera's view (view frustum)
                still being rendered as if they were inside the view frustum.
